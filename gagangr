      A datatype specifies the type of a variable.
      
What is a variable?

                          20, 2.2, 'c'.
  
what is a compiler?
   A c compiler is a program which takes a C program file and creates a exectuble program file
   
What is a file.
   A file is where we store information.
   Files are used for permanent retention of data. Computers store files on secondary
   storage devices, especially disk storage devices. 
     
where do we type a programme?
    In the editor, ide, or in onlinegdb.
    
why is semicolon used after every statement?

   3. It is the syntax of function.
   
when we use printf,why should we put everything under double quotations?
   doubles quotes are used to denote strings to the compiler.
   main is function name  "main" string literal.
   main()
   {
   printf("main");
   }

what is stdio.h? 
  It is a a system header file stored in /usr/include.
  The header file contains prototypes for functions.
  Compilers use function prototypes to check if the right type and right number of parmeter
  are passed by the calling function to the called function.
    For example.
       Calling function is main.
       Called function is printf
       the prototype of printf is in stdio.h.
    
wy should we only use return 0 ?
    What ever main function return goes to the shell from which the program is invoked.
    This values is used to verify if the program ran successfully.
    In link 0 means success  and any other values means failure.

 what is preprocessor?
        In a C system,a preprocessor program executes automatically before the compiler’s translation phase begins.
        The C preprocessor obeys special commands called preprocessor directives, 
        
what is compailer.what dose it do? 
        The compiler translatesthe C program into machine language-code (also referred to as object code).
     or Compilers translate high-level language programs into machine-language programs. High-level
        languages (like C) contain English words and conventional mathematical notations
        
what is secoundery devise?        
   at first we wants to write the c program what we have known with help of editor program, and then copail it.
   if we get error correct it. store in to secounddery device like hard disk.the compiler translates the C program into machine-language
   code.
what is linker   
    A linker links object code with the code for library functions to produce an executable image. 
    (OR) In computer science, a linker is a computer program that takes one or more object files generated by a
    compiler and combines them into one, executable program.
    
what is loader
     Before a program can be executed, the program must first
     be placed in memory. This is done by the loader, which takes the executable image from
     disk and transfers it to memory
     
   To write the programe on the linux baserd system we wants to follow some rules,
 editor,preprocessor,compailer,linker,loader,cpu.
 we need to type the c program with the help of editor command, and that must store on secoundery devise.
 preprocessor is used to executes the programe before the compailation.
 compailer used compail the programes and stores in the diskes, executes the errors
 linker combains one or more files and combine in to one.
 loader is used to store the programe into memory,
